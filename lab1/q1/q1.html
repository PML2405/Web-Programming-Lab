        <h2>“Sonnet 18” by William Shakespeare.</h2>
        <p>
            Shall I compare thee to a summer’s <b>day?</b><br>
            Thou art more lovely and more <b>temperate</b>. <br>
            Rough winds do shake the darling buds of <b>May</b>, <br>
            And summer’s lease hath all too short a <b>date</b>.  <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometime too hot the eye of heaven <b>shines</b>,<br>
            And often is his gold complexion <b>dimmed</b>;<br>
            And every fair from fair sometime <b>declines</b>,<br>
            By chance, or nature’s changing course, <b>untrimmed</b>;<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            But thy eternal summer shall not <b>fade</b>,<br>
            Nor lose possession of that fair thou <b>ow’st</b>;<br>
            Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his <b>shade</b>,<br>
            When in eternal lines to time thou <b>grow’st</b>: <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            So long as men can breathe, or eyes can <b>see</b>,<br>
            So long lives this, and this gives life to <b>thee</b>. <br>
        </p>
